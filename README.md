**CEIPP** is an advanced AI assistant designed to bridge the gap between complex government procurement regulations and institutional operational efficiency at King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang (KMITL). By leveraging **Generative AI** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, it automates receipt verification and provides instant, source-grounded regulatory consultation.

## 🌟 Core Intelligence Modules

### 1. 👁️ Smart OCR Auditor (Vision AI)
- **Multimodal Extraction**: Utilizes **Google Gemini 1.5 Flash** to extract high-fidelity Thai text from receipts and tax invoices.
- **5-Point Compliance Check**: Automated validation of Vendor details, Transaction dates, Total amounts, Buyer identification, and mandatory Signatures/Stamps.
- **Smart Priority Logic**: Intelligent bypass for certified corporate vendors (e.g., Makro, 7-11), reducing administrative bottlenecks for computer-generated invoices.

### 2. 💬 Regulatory Consultant (RAG Chatbot)
- **Extensive Knowledge Base**: Indexed repository of **29 official KMITL and Ministry of Finance PDFs**.
- **Evidence-Grounded Answers**: Every response includes **Filename and Page Number** citations to ensure maximum transparency.
- **Thai-Optimized Retrieval**: Custom regex-based text cleaning minimizes character corruption, ensuring precise semantic search results for the Thai language.

### 3. 📊 Admin Monitoring & AI Evaluation
- **LLM-as-a-Judge Framework**: Employs **Gemma 3 4B** to quantitatively evaluate AI performance across **Faithfulness (4.51/5.0), Answer Relevance (4.45/5.0), and Context Precision (4.02/5.0)**.
- **Benchmarked Performance**: Achieving **91.64% Avg Recall@10** and **0.75 MRR** across a comprehensive 323-item golden dataset.
- **Real-time Analytics**: Interactive dashboard visualizing user feedback trends, approval distributions, and RAG accuracy benchmarks.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### 1. Prerequisite Environments
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ratthabhumi/CEIPP.git
cd CEIPP
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure API Credentials
Create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file or provide keys via the application sidebar:
```toml
OPENROUTER_API_KEY = "your_openrouter_key"
